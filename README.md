DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK PERFORMED ---
This project involved performing sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically applying the Naive Bayes classification algorithm in combination with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. The TF-IDF method was used to convert raw text into meaningful numerical features by evaluating the importance of words in relation to the document and the entire corpus. A Multinomial Naive Bayes model was trained on the vectorized data to classify text entries into sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral.

The model achieved an approximate accuracy of 70%, demonstrating reliable performance in distinguishing between different sentiments. To evaluate the model's output, a comparison was made between the actual and predicted sentiments. This comparison included computing the total counts for each sentiment category and visualizing the distributions using bar charts. These insights provided a clearer understanding of the model's classification tendencies and class balance. The results were saved in an Excel file to support further analysis and reporting. This implementation highlights the effectiveness of classical machine learning techniques in text classification tasks and establishes a foundation for future improvements using more advanced NLP models.
